Sometimes you have a structural model with standardized path coefficients, structural coefficients, and correlations, but you do not know the error and disturbance variances. The purpose of `simstandard` is to calculate these variances and then simulate multivariate normal data based on your model.

## Installation

You can either install simstandard from CRAN or install the development version of simstandard from github.

### Option 1: Install the most recent stable release from CRAN

You can install simstandard from CRAN by running this code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("simstandard")
```

### Option 2: Install the development version from GitHub

To install the development version of simstandard, you need to check if the remotes packages is installed. If not, run this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
```

Once you are sure you have the remotes package installed, you can install the development version of simstandard from GitHub by running this code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("wjschne/simstandard")
```

## Example

The `simstandard` package uses [lavaan syntax](https://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/syntax1.html) to specify models.

```{r example}
library(simstandard)
model <- "
A =~ 0.5 * A1 + 0.8 * A2
B =~ 0.6 * B1 + 0.7 * B2
B ~ 0.8 * A
C ~~ 0.5 * A
"
data <- sim_standardized(m = model, n = 500)

knitr::kable(head(data), digits = 2)
```

See more in the [tutorial for this package](https://wjschne.github.io/simstandard//articles/simstandard_tutorial.html).
